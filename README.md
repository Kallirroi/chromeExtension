# clickHere.

ClickHere is a Chrome plugin that automatically transforms a web page to an abstract attentional tapestry. The project takes on an interface critique standpoint by asking the following questions: how do our habitual online spaces transform themselves when reduced to only a few building blocks? More specifically, what does a browser window look like when all attention-hungry elements are emphasized?
